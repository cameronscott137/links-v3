      <h2>One-time grant support (currently accepting applications)</h2>
      <p>The LINKS program includes a limited pool of funding, portions of which may potentially be granted to support governmental, non-governmental or private sector organizations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the areas of hypertension control, salt reduction or elimination of artificial trans fat.  One-time grants are intended to catalyze or advance country progress toward improvement of cardiovascular health.
      </p>
      <p>Recipients of the first and second rounds of LINKS one-time grant support were announced on 20 March 2019 and 07 November 2019, respectively! You can read the press releases: <a href="https://www.linkscommunity.org/s/LINKS-funding-press-release_global_FINAL-kl42.pdf" target="_blank">Round 1</a> & <a href="https://www.linkscommunity.org/s/_GLOBAL-LINKS-Grant-Press-Release-11-2019.pdf" target="_blank">Round 2</a>. Please note, the countries listed in the press release <u>do not</u> reflect a list of priority countries.

      <p style="margin-left: 300px;">*****
      </p>
      <p>We are now accepting applications under two request for proposals mechanisms: <strong>1)</strong> regular LINKS applications and <strong>2) </strong>cardiovascular health (CVH) and COVID-19 rapid response applications.
      </p>
      <p>The deadline to submit a regular application is <strong>November 15, 2020</strong>. These grants will be funded for up to 18 months with a maximum value of $200,000 USD for hypertension control programs and $125,000 for sodium reduction and trans fat elimination programs. A decision will not be made until all applications are received and reviewed. Successful grants will be awarded by March 2021.
      </p>
      <p>The deadline to submit a CVH +COVID-19 rapid response application is <strong>December 31, 2020, </strong>note applications will be accepted and approved on a rolling basis. These grants will be funded for up to 6 months with awards ranging from $10,000-$50,000 USD.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to the alignment with the WHO HEARTS, SHAKE and REPLACE technical packages described above, successful requests for one-time grant support should demonstrate the organization's capacity to ensure that this one-time support will result in <strong>sustained progress toward improving cardiovascular health beyond the duration of the grant.</strong>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Calls for proposals</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
      	<li><strong>Hypertension proposals</strong> should focus on building or catalyzing quality and sustainable programming to diagnose, treat and care for patients with hypertension and should conform to the five key steps needed to implement the WHO HEARTS technical package as described below. For this call for applications, priority will be given to applications that: </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
      	<li>Incorporates hypertension management in an HIV care setting, and builds off of decentralized HIV systems, including differentiated service delivery models, to provide person-centered care. </li>
      	<li>Work with the private, non-governmental sector to support quality hypertension programs that conform to the WHO HEARTS technical package. Proposals for private sector engagement may include work to incentivize the provision of quality care in the private sector, such as through improving health insurance reimbursement or incentive policies, so long as there is a plan for sustainability. </li>
      	<li>Implements telemedicine and/or other digital solutions to support the provision of hypertension care and treatment, especially when linked to community-based, patient-centered services and/or task shifting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Key components of the WHO HEARTS package include:
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Implement practical treatment protocols which are drug- and dose-specific and which establish steps to take if blood pressure is not controlled. Use of standardized, evidence-based protocols reduces clinical variability and results in more efficient and cost-effective selection of medications and treatment approaches. <i>Please review the </i><a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/260421/WHO-NMH-NVI-18.2-eng.pdf;jsessionid=16DEB9EEC9B14E47171664A6D6559D87?sequence=1"><i>HEARTS E Module</i></a><i> </i>for additional information<i>.</i></li>
      	<li>Regular and uninterrupted supply of medications and equipment to ensure that the right medications and equipment get to the right place at the right time and reach the patients<br> who need them. <i>Please review the </i><a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/260420/WHO-NMH-NVI-18.3-eng.pdf?sequence=1"><i>HEARTS A module</i></a><i> for additional information.</i></li>
      	<li>Community-based care and task sharing so health workers who are accessible to patients in their communities can provide, adjust and intensify medication regimens according to physician orders and protocols. <i>Please review the </i><a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/260424/WHO-NMH-NVI-18.4-eng.pdf?sequence=1"><i>HEARTS T module</i></a><i> for additional information.</i></li>
      	<li>Patient-centered services which reduce barriers to care by lowering medical costs, increasing the convenience of medical visits and refills, including through visit spacing for stable patients, providing once-daily regimens with the minimum number of pills possible, and improving access to blood pressure monitoring, including in homes, pharmacies and other public places.</li>
      	<li>Information systems that allow continuous, real-time monitoring to improve follow-up of patients whose blood pressure is not under control, measure program quality and coverage, and allow analysis of program data to improve patient care and system performance. <i>Please review the </i><a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/260423/WHO-NMH-NVI-18.5-eng.pdf?sequence=1"><i>HEARTS S module</i></a><i> for additional information.</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, proposals should Include a clear and feasible plan for sustainability after the grant closure and/or provides a rationale for why the project is important in building towards national or regional scale and sustainability. Deliverables that reflect sustainability include updating hypertension guidelines and operational guidance to reflect the HEARTS package, funding mobilization either through domestic, private or donor assistance and strengthening language on hypertension goals and targets in key documents, such as national strategic plans. To this end, proposals may include funding for advocacy and political engagement.
      </p>
      <p>2. <strong>Salt reduction proposals</strong> should focus on the development and implementation of policy approaches to reduce population salt intake.
      </p>
      <p><i>Priority will be given to proposals that (1) include scalable and sustainable policy strategies that can achieve large-scale population sodium reduction and (2) that have a reasonable chance of success/adoption.</i> <i>Policy approaches proposed must include salt reduction but do not need to be limited to them (e.g. front of pack labeling often covers multiple nutrients).</i>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Successful grant applications will include support for one of the following policies</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Front-of-pack labeling, in particular front of pack warning labels as pioneered by Chile (more information available <a href="https://www.paho.org/en/documents/approval-new-food-act-chile-entry-force-june-2016-process-summary">here via PAHO</a>)</li>
      	<li>Packaged food reformulation, such as voluntary salt reduction targets or mandatory maximum salt levels for key categories of food  </li>
      	<li>Taxation of salt or high salt foods</li>
      	<li>Promotion/subsidization of low sodium salt or low sodium condiments/products to encourage wide-spread uptake</li>
      	<li>Food marketing restrictions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>3. <strong>Trans fat elimination proposals</strong> should support the ultimate goal of establishing best practice policies to eliminate artificial trans fat and replacing them with healthier fats/oils. Best practice policies include:  a mandatory limit on industrially produced trans fat to 2% of total fat in all fats, oils & foods and a ban on the production or use of partially-hydrogenated oils as an ingredient in all foods.
      </p>
      <p><i>Priority will be given to 1) </i><i>countries where there is demonstrated political interest or will for trans fat elimination, including (but not limited to) countries in Latin America where, in 2019, countries </i><a href="https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15480:agreement-to-eliminate-trans-fatty-acids-from-industrial-food-production-aims-to-prevent-cardiovascular-disease&Itemid=1926&lang=en#:~:text=The%20PAHO%20regional%20plan%20proposes,a%20proportion%20of%20total%20fat"><i>unanimously agreed to eliminate trans fat</i></a><i> in foods; and 2) countries that do not already have best practice or less restrictive mandatory trans fat limits in place. The </i><a href="https://extranet.who.int/nutrition/gina/en/scorecard/TFA"><i>WHO TFA Country Score Card</i></a><i> map shows countries that have best practice trans fat policies, less restrictive trans fat limits, other complementary measures, or a national policy commitment to eliminate trans fat.</i>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Successful grant applications will include one of the following activities:</strong><br>
      </p>
      <p><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Policy advocacy or policy development</li>
      	<li>Evidence generation to directly advance best practice policies to eliminate artificial trans fat</li>
      	<li>Communications campaigns to build public debate and political will for trans fat elimination</li>
      	<li>Food studies, however, these will only be funded if the applicant can demonstrate that a laboratory with capacities to measure trans fat has been identified and, if the laboratory is located abroad, that samples can be shipped without logistical challenges.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>4. <strong>CVH + COVID-19 policy proposals </strong>should promote funding for and/or policies that advance cardiovascular disease prevention. Preference will be given to nutrition policies that include either salt reduction or trans fat elimination as part of the policy.  The policy proposal must be achievable within approximately 6 months and clearly identify the time-limited opportunity that has arisen because of COVID-19. The policy may be national or sub-national and should demonstrate the potential for broader regional or global impact.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Example of possible CVH + COVID 19 proposals include but are not limited to:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Legislation to ban the sale of highly processed foods to vulnerable or high risk populations similar to the policies recently passed in Oaxaca and Tabasco, Mexico (more information available <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/19/mexico-kids-junk-food-ban/">here via The Washington Post</a> and <a href="https://congresotabasco.gob.mx/boletin/aprueba-lxiii-legislatura-eliminar-venta-y-distribucion-de-comida-chatarra-y-bebidas-azucaradas-a-menores-de-edad/">here via the Congress of Tabasco in Spanish</a>)</li>
      	<li>Policies to promote or expand telemedicine or mobile medication delivery services to ensure the continuity of care despite service interruptions due to COVID-19</li>
      </ul>
