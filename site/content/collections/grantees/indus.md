  <blockquote>“Every South Asian knows someone within their close family or network who has undergone a bypass surgery or died due to a cardiac arrest. This could be prevented if high blood pressure was caught at an earlier stage and appropriately managed. Receiving this grant is an excellent opportunity for us to integrate hypertension screening into our primary care programs. We will have the opportunity to offer screening to patients entering our health system, identifying high risk adults who may otherwise have been missed.”
