  <p>ILA has more than ten years’ experience in policy research and advocacy on risk factors for noncommunicable diseases in Kenya, with particular expertise in tobacco control.

Currently, ILA also participates in Ministry of Health technical working groups to guide implementation of the national strategy on NCDs.
