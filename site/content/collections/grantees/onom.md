  <p>The Onom Foundation is non-governmental organization working to promote sustainable progress in Mongolia by advancing education, healthcare, and democracy. Since 2018, the Onom Foundation has been an implementing partner for the Better Hearts Better Cities – Ulaanbaatar Program, using the World Health Organization’s HEARTS technical package to improve high blood pressure care in Ulaanbaatar.
  </p>
  <p>With LINKS support, the ONOM Foundation will expand the successful hypertension control program from Ulaanbaatar to Mongolia’s 21 provinces. The project includes training healthcare professionals on hypertension care, and increasing screening, diagnosis and control of hypertension across the Mongolian population.
  </p>
  <blockquote style="margin-left: 2px;">“Cardiovascular disease is an epidemic that affects almost everyone in Mongolian society— it causes more than one third of all deaths. The LINKS grant means an opportunity for us to expand the work we’ve been doing in the capital to the rest of the country, and improve high blood pressure care for over one million people.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>Naranjargal Dashdorj, CEO of the Onom Foundation.
