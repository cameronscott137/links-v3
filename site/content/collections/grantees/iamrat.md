  <p>Part of the University of Ibadan’s College of Medicine, the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Research Unit (EBRU) of The Institute of Advanced Medical Research and Training’s (IAMRAT)  is a multi-disciplinary team with experience in epidemiology, malariology, medical sociology and anthropology, biostatistics, health promotion and health education, and health economics and information. EBRU-IAMRAT has published a number of notable studies, including an estimate of the local burden of hypertension in Ibadan, Nigeria, and evaluated interventions in different settings, including schools and the community, to support evidence-based policy making.
  </p>
  <p>With support from LINKS, EBRU-IAMRAT will work in primary schools currently implementing Nigeria’s National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme, which provides meals to school children using food from local producers. EBRU-IAMRAT will determine the salt content of meals
  </p>
  <blockquote>“Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in Nigeria, and the incidence of hypertension is on the increase, especially among children and young adults. With this grant, we will be able to study the effect of an intervention to reduce salt content in school meals, which could improve the cardiovascular health of vulnerable school children. The intervention also stands to create awareness in the children’s household and community about the harms of eating too much salt.”
