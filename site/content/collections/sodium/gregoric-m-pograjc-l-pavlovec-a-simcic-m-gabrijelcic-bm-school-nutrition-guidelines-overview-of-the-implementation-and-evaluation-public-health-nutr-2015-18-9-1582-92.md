  <p>Describes three methods of evaluating the implementation of dietary guidelines in schools in Slovenia: (i) a cross-sectional survey, (ii) an indicator-based evaluation of menu quality; and (iii) a five day weighted food record of school lunches (output evaluation). The multi-level evaluation suggests that some differences in implementation are attributed to school characteristics; system changes may improve implementation.
