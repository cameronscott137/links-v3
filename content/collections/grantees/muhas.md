  <p>MUHAS is a public university in Tanzania that provides training, research and services in health and related fields. MUHAS participated in the development of Tanzania’s 2016-2021 National Multisectoral Nutrition Action Plan, which includes trans fat elimination as a target.
  </p>
  <p>With support from LINKS, MUHAS will conduct the first-ever assessment of levels of harmful trans fats in Tanzania’s local street foods, fast foods and edible oils/fats, laying the groundwork for future trans fat elimination advocacy.

  <blockquote>“In my community, cardiovascular diseases are increasingly common, including life threatening complications like stroke and heart failure. Knowing of the amount of trans fats in Tanzanian foods will help guide the community for better and healthy choices, and spur policy action towards the elimination of trans fats from the Tanzanian food chain. This grant will allow us to influence policy and practice towards the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease.”
  </blockquote>
  <p>Fredirick Mashili, lecturer and research officer at the East African Center of Excellence in Cardiovascular Sciences
