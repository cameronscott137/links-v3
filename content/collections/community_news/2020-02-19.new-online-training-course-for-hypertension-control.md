  <p>This week Johns Hopkins launched a free, online training course, “Fundamentals for Implementing a Hypertension Program in Resource-Constrained Settings”! This online course aims to help program managers and implementers in designing, planning, and implementing a hypertension control program.
  </p>
  <p>We know that each setting is unique, and every factor involved in implementing this type of program cannot be addressed in one course. However, the course modules provide the basic knowledge necessary for successful program implementation and includes useful tips relevant to different settings and other types of personnel like physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and community-health workers.<br>
  </p>
  <p>We hope this course will help you implement and manage a successful hypertension program. You can access the course at: <a href="https://nam03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fglobalhypertensionathopkins.org%2F&data=02%7C01%7Cdcazabon%40resolvetosavelives.org%7C1ec111b4a27c4cd3195008d7afcde3fa%7Cdcb8a8f481b349b79bc29cca6af0eebf%7C0%7C0%7C637171171155019806&sdata=hBunN%2F8P7RzM455veeDu4j0M%2Bu8vMebiJVAofPjy7eM%3D&reserved=0">https://globalhypertensionathopkins.org/</a>
