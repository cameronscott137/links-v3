  <p>Resolve to Save Lives, an initative of Vital Strategies, will partner with city, state/provincial, or national governments to develop, implement, and evaluate healthy public food procurement policies.
  </p>
  <p>We are looking for programs that adopt a whole-of-government approach, rather than limit the intervention to one government agency (e.g., schools), and which have the policy commitment to implement rapidly and evaluate openly.
  </p>
  <p>Proposals should cover a time frame of no more than one year and will be funded up to USD $75,000. The<strong> deadline to submit an application is February 3, 2020</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>You can <a href="https://tinyurl.com/uqjtpsh">download the terms of the proposal request here</a>. Please send any questions and applications to Nicole Ide at <a href="mailto:nide@resolvetosavelives.org">nide@resolvetosavelives.org</a>.
