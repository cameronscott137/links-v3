Why not add a second drug before intensifying treatment with the first?Do all anti-hypertensive medications and dosages need to be prescribed by a physician or can these protocols use task-sharing with non-physician health workers?Why does Resolve to Save Lives focus on blood pressure level for treatment initiation rather than cardiovascular risk?What is the best practice for managing treatment interruption/missed medication doses?Should the protocol approach differ for asymptomatic patients with very elevated blood pressure (e.g. ≥180 mmHg systolic blood pressure or ≥110 mmHg diastolic blood pressure)?How should medications be managed when a patient on medications has lower than normal blood pressure?Is it better to take antihypertensive medications in the morning or evening?'
